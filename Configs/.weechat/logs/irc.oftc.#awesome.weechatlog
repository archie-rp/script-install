2013-11-05 22:36:23	Archierp	anyone know what "server" imap on gmail is? on lain widgets
2013-11-05 22:38:52	Archierp	i put imap.gmail.com but i m getting errors 
2013-11-05 22:39:37	crazedpsyc	for gmail you have to use the web interface to enable imap first, if you haven't done that part.
2013-11-05 22:41:37	landscape69	right.. first activate imap on webinterface, then u can use imap

2013-11-05 22:45:46	Archierp	how active? please... or i have to install imap on aur?
2013-11-05 22:46:07	crazedpsyc	err, that didn't make sense.
2013-11-05 22:46:36	crazedpsyc	Archierp: go to your gmail web mail. hit the settings button. somewhere in there is an option to enable imap for the account
2013-11-05 22:46:46	crazedpsyc	not sure which tab, I don't use it personally
2013-11-05 22:48:20	Archierp	 thanks i will do it  :)
